        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Iris project will be governed with the following approach.  An active community contributes to 
the day-to-day development and upkeep of the project. We expect the community to contribute to 
decisions through open debate. A benevolent dictator will led the project and act as final arbitrator 
on decisions.</p>
        <h2>Roles and responsibilities</h2>
        <h3>Users</h3>
        <p>Users download and use Iris. They are the reason Iris has been created and developed. We want to 
know what problems they experience and ideas they have so we can improve the software. 
Become a User by downloading Iris and start using it now</p>
        <h3>Contributors</h3>
        <p>Contributors are people who contribute to the Iris project but do not have privileges to merge a pull 
request to the master. Contributions can be made by bug fixes, adding new code, reporting bugs, 
updating or writing new documentation and gallery additions.</p> 
 
<p>Become a Contributor with any of the tasks described above.  Please note that merging of source 
code contributions is at the discretion of the Developers and follows an iterative dialogue. We will 
also need a completed Contributor’s Licence Agreement (CLA).</P>
 
<p>We will be following the ‘review-then-commit’ process of merging contributions into the project.</p>
 
<p>Major and effective contributors to the project will be invited to become developers by the 
development lead.</p>
        <h3>Developers</h3>
        <p>Developers are responsible for reviewing and merging Contributors bug fixes, new code and/or 
documentation from submitted pull requests into the master. They also ensure that everyone who 
wishes to contribute has submitted a CLA</p>
        <h3>Owners</h3>
        <p>Owners are responsible for the repository and for granting privileges</p>
        
        <h3>Development lead</h3>
        <p>The Development lead for Iris are a team of developers led by Richard Hattersley (benevolent 
dictator) from the Met Office. It is the Development lead’s responsibility to ensure the quality of the 
source code and documentation remains high and that the integrity of the project is preserved. To 
achieve this, the Development lead will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Define coding standards</li>
          <li>Define development methodologies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Development lead together with representatives from Business, Legal, TIS and Science 
directorates of the Met Office are currently responsible for the overall direction of the project.</p>
        
        <h2>Support</h2>
        <p>Support is offered on a best endeavour only and is provided as time and resources allow. That said  
support is an important activity for the Developers as it provides an opportunity to work closely with 
people using Iris. It is from these events that real value is generated that can be brought back into 
the project. We have listed below the available support channels for the project.</p>

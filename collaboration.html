          <h1>Collaboration</h1>
<p>
Iris and Cartopy are free and open source projects, published under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">LGPLv3</a> licence.  Both libraries work extensively with third party free and open source libraries.
</p>

<p>
One of the primary objectives of this approach is to aid collaboration and collaborative development.
</p>

<h2>Depending on SciTools</h2>

<p>
The SciTools projects provide capabilities for developers to make use of.  Projects depending on SciTools Libraries are encouraged to engage with the development process, through the <a href="../iris/pages/community.html">Community Forums</a> and the <a href="http://github.com/scitools">GitHub</a> code development sites. It is hoped that this will lead to developers contributing code to SciTools Libraries.
</p>


<h2>Contributing to SciTools</h2>
 
<p>
Contributions to the SciTools open source libraries are encouraged: the pages on <a href="governance.html">governance</a> and the <a href="../iris/docs/latest/developers_guide/index.html">developer's guide</a> provide information on what is involved in SciTools collaborative development.
</p>

<p>
Small scale contributions fit well with this model, such as bug fixes and new feature implementations to current modules.  Larger scale development activities require different approaches.
</p>

<h2>Developing alongside SciTools</h2>

<p>
For a larger scale activity it may be helpful to develop slightly separate from SciTools, to enable an approach to be cultivated and trials of coding methods to be conducted.
</p>

<p>
Often the results of such activities may be suggestions of code contributions to a SciTools module, useful code which does not fit with a particular SciTools module's scope and, in general, some combination of these two scenarios.
</p>

<h3>Forking</h3>

One option is to fork a SciTools module, following the path for contributing, but without an explicit intention of putting in a pull request.  This enables a developer to experiment and publish the results of their experiment, under the terms and conditions of the SciTools module.

Such an experimental fork can serve as a public testing ground for ideas and implementations, giving a tangible and testable code base that may help with discussions of approaches and agreement on a particular approach which could lead to a pull request on a SciTools module and code inclusion. 

<h3>Publishing Code</h3>

<p>An alternative approach is to set up another project, dependent on SciTools, and develop this project.</p>

<p>
For any potential collaborative development activity it is important that the code base is available to collaborators and licensed to enable collaboration.
</p>
<p>
Publishing on a site such as <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, the <a href="http://www-avd/~itmh/scitools.org.uk/governance.html#contributors">SciTools Contributors </a> approach and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html"> LGPLv3</a> license present one way of managing this, but it is the responsibility of a publisher to manage these matters as they see fit.
</p>


<p>Such public projects, dependent on SciTools modules are likely to provide a rich seam of ideas and approaches, leading to developments in SciTools modules which can be adopted and shared across the SciTools communities.</p>

<h2>Adoption of Code</h2>

Adoption of code into SciTools libraries will follow the <a href="governance.html">governance</a> and then refer to our <a href="iris/docs/latest/developers_guide/index.html">developer's guide</a> procedures.

In most cases discussions via Github issues and the developer communities (<a href="iris/community.html"> iris </a> and <a href="http://www-avd/~itmh/scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html#getting-involved"> cartopy </a>) will be required, to detail scope, interfaces and design considerations.  Providing publicly available code which can be developed collaboratively will enable more detailed and focussed discussions of the relevant issues.
